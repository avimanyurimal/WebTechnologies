            <p> Dwayne Douglas Johnson (born May 2, 1972), also known by his ring name The Rock,is an American actor
                and former professional wrestler. Widely regarded as one of the greatest professional wrestlers of all
                time, he was integral to the development and success of the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now
                WWE) during the Attitude Era, an industry boom period in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Johnson
                wrestled for the WWF for eight years prior to pursuing an acting career. His films have grossed over
                $3.5 billion in North America and over $10.5 billion worldwide,making him one of the world's
                highest-grossing and highest-paid actors.After accepting an athletic scholarship to play at the
                University of Miami, he was a member of the 1991national championship team, but largely spent his four college
                football years in backup roles behind elite players, including future NFL player.
                Johnson aspired to play professional football but went undrafted in the 1995 NFL Draft. Following his
                graduation, he signed with the Calgary Stampeders but was cut from the team in his first season. In
                1996, Johnson's father Rocky, a longtime professional wrestler, assisted in helping him secure a
                contract with the WWF. Johnson quickly rose to global prominence, aided by a gimmick he employed as a
                charismatic trash talker. Johnson left WWE in 2004 and returned in 2011 as a part-time performer until
                2013, making sporadic appearances until retiring in 2019.A 10-time world champion, including the
                promotion's first of African-American descent, he is also a two-time Intercontinental Champion, a
                five-time Tag Team Champion, the 2000 Royal Rumble winner, and WWE's sixth Triple Crown champion.
                Johnson headlined the most-bought professional wrestling pay-per-view (WrestleMania XXVIII) and was
                featured among the most watched episodes of WWE's flagship television series (Raw and
                SmackDown).Johnson's first film appearance was in The Mummy Returns (2001). The following year he played 
                his firsleading role as the titular character in the sword and sorcery action fantasy film The Scorpion 
                Kin(2002). He has since starred in family films The Game Plan (2007), Race to Witch Mountain (2009), Toot 
                Fairy (2010), and Jungle Cruise (2021), as well as the action adventure films Journey 2: The Mysteriou 
                Island (2012), G.I. Joe: Retaliation (2013), Hercules (2014), Skyscraper (2018), San Andreas (2015) an 
                Rampage (2018). He also starred in the action comedy films Get Smart (2008), Central Intelligenc (2016),
